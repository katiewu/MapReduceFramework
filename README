I implemented simplified MapReduce framework in Java. The framework consists of two types of nodes: a single master and a number of workers. The master node assigns tasks to workers and coordinates among the workers; the workers are in charge of running map and reduce functions, and of storing the data. The master has a status page which displays the list of workers that are currently online and some information about each. My MapReduce framework also supports load balancing to avoid that some of the workers have already finished tasks but others are still busy.

Instructions:
1. The master and workers are implemented as Java Servlets. Load master servlets and worker servlets into different servlet container
